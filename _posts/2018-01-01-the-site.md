## What I have learnt from my site.

There are obviously ideal sites in the world; Napa, Malborough, Mendoza, to name but a few.  For me a South facing slope was enough.  For me the balance was in location for the day job, a house the wife liked, ok loved.  Size of the purse is going to play a big part too.

The essentials are the soil, topography (lie of the land), climate and time!

You can read plenty about soil, to a point were you get obsessed and never find the perfect site.  There are ‘apps’ (my soil) and websites (http://www.landis.org.uk/soilscapes/).  Mine is by no means perfect.  Six inches of top soil, two foot of clay, then beautiful brashy chalk.  If i could remove all of the top two foot it would be ideal, but I have to wait for the vine roots to get through the clay, no mean feat.  So cultivation to break the clay pan is essential.  Clay is good for holding nutrients, takes time to warm up in the Spring, but holds the heat in the Autumn.  Waterlogging is an issue, plus workability.  The pH is alkaline, due to the chalk.  It was previously an arable field so the organic content is poor, spent mushroom compost is ideal.

I’ve seen some sites where the soil is so fertile the vines in the first year grew 6-7ft.  I think that for a good site the vines have to struggle – this seems to be a known fact.  Better characters come from stressed vines.  So I wasn’t concerned that mine weren’t racing away, I’ve learnt to be patient and not push them early on.  That’s a top tip!


The soil, will be a critical part of vine and rootstock choice (I’ve gone for SO4).

Topography; south facing slope seems a given.  Not sure about the slope, Shawsgate is pretty flat, whereas Sharpham is incredibly steep – wouldn’t want to be driving the tractor.  I have a gentle slope, no snowboarding.  There are no large trees to give shade, or roots to take nutrients.  However, I’ve planted plenty of hedge to give a windbreak.  Yes it is a pretty windy spot, we actually changed the name of the house from Windy Heights!  The other crucial part is frost, which can have such a devastating impact on a vineyard.  Avoid frost pockets at all cost.

Time, don’t rush into it,  take time to cultivate, correct pH and nutrient deficiencies – easier to do to a large area than in between vines. A good time to plant several different vine varieties and rootstocks to test and see what grows best.  Did I do that – no.  I’ll come on to vine choice later.  Ok, yes I did cultivate, but only the top six inches for the first lot I planted.  I did learn and subsoiled (which fitted perfectly with my row spacing – more on this later on) for the next planting.

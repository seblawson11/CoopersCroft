### Summer 2002

We stayed near Nyons. In a beautiful Chateau. With vineyards all around us.

At Chateau Trignon, we got to taste the fresh grape juice straight from the vat.

We visited Chateau La Canorgue, where A Good Year was filmed.

At Domain de la Garrigue, we watched two guys putting the corks on the bottles with a simple mechanical device, of course they were smoking gitane.

I fell in love with Ventoux wine. Only problem – you can’t grow those varieties successfully in the UK.

### 13th June 2003 How it all started

I got these two vines from Wyken Hall not far from where I lived in Bury St Edmunds. I had a lovely Victorian town house, with a walled garden perfect for growing something. I didn’t want flowers, I wanted to be productive. I always remembered my Father making wine when I was a kid. My girlfriend at the time worked for the local brewery, I worked and still do in agriculture. The previous year we had spent the summer in the vineyards of the Rhone region, I’ll post a pic of a few of the chateaus we went to.

So the answer had to be vines. I didn’t know anything, I know a little more now.

### Back garden vineyard
Ok, so not really a vineyard, just the two vines. I look back now and see how badly trained they were. I didn’t know anything about it then, how much I know now, come a long way in just a few years.  Still fun to see where it all started from.

The grapes continued to grow…

### Shawsgate
So if i was going to find out more, where could I go.  Courses at Plumpton which was two and an half hours away were more full-time.  I couldn’t give up the day job, well not just yet.  So the next best thing was to visit local vineyards, to find out more I spoke with Tom at Shawsgate (little did I realise that my first Vendange would be bottle here).  I popped over a few times to look at varieties, the lay of the land, trellising, the whole set up to get an idea of what i would need.

My wife Jen bought me a present, the rent of a row of vines there (May 2009).

Which I visited a few times.

It was all a great experience, but could I do this?

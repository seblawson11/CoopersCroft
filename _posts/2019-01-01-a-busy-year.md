## Early May…

Pinot finally at bud burst

Well a busy time of year, pruning completed and not long after the buds started to swell.  Bud burst has now begun, although only in the protection of the tubes.

Let’s hope that there are no late frosts.  Frost can damage and potentially kill the buds, having a substantial effect on the vine, not only for this season, but also in terms of trellising for future seasons.


## EAVA Waffle and Walk

At a recent EAVA waffle and walk, we visited Bardfield vineyard, we had good discussions on training, early inputs required and maintenance of older vines.  Plus demonstration of ‘tow and blow’ kit; the idea that the constant movement of air would prevent damaging frosts.

If there is one improvement in vine varieties, then frost tolerance would be my choice.

I’ve also put up some more wire, with help from my father-in-law.  Only another 6km to go to complete the block of Bacchus.  Anchoring the end posts is still to be done as well, just waiting for the right soil conditions, honest.


## Training

The right training and qualifications are important, so I’ve attended the NPTC PA3A sprayer course for air assisted sprays which are necessary for the application of fungicide (and foliar nutrients) to the vine canopy.

Now i just have to plan my input programme.


## Weed control

An important job to get done before bud burst is weed control around the base of the vines.

The best option is to use a non-selective herbicide.  This will pretty much take everything out, at the appropriate rate, including the vines, so be sure that there are plastic tubes covering the vine trunk.  It does take a long time to work, depending on conditions – slower when it’s colder and the weeds aren’t growing.  Best timing of course is when the weeds are small, but actively growing.

Clearing the ground under the vines;
  + prevents loss of nutrients and moisture,
  + leaves room for fertiliser application,
  + prevents microclimate conducive to diseases,
  + allows direct sunlight on soil to help warming up,
  + and apart from all that the obvious…… looks neater.


## September…

Been a while since I’ve written. the birth of our second daughter Matilda has wonderfully kept me busy. I wonder what I did with my time before having two children……

Now on holiday at the in-laws in Devon.  First break in I can’t remember when.  And yes have planned to visit a few of the local vineyards when I’m here: Lily Farm, Sidbury and Castlewood.

Next step is crucial.  I have an acre, a thousand vines.  Enough for me to handle with the time and equipment I’ve got.  Plus the produce should be consumable within friends and family, with the option of selling a years worth now and again to cover cost.

So do I plant another 500?

I have space, but do I have the time and will that put me over the edge from happy amateur to small business.  Plus I need to work out what variety to plant.  Hence the reason to go and visit other vineyards and pick their brains, see the size/scale of their operations and how I compare and what route to take.

I’d be happy to plant more.  I love the escape and joy it gives me (small note, also the angst of doing things right).  However some sense of realism needs to come into it, I can’t drink a thousand bottles now can I, so what is the plan???

If I could do it all again, I’d plant a dozen varieties with a similar variety of rootstock. my current feeling is the Bacchus that should be more suited to the UK conditions looks poor and I’m not impressed by it.  More inputs/husbandry required.  Whereas the Pinot Noir looks good, really happy with it.  Also among the Pinot I planted a few odds.  The two from my old Victorian terrace in Bury; Madeline Angevine and Rondo – neither on root-stock, just propagated aren’t doing too badly.  The Rondo looks really good, the leaf is massive, but the bunches have a few blind sites.  The Cabernet Sauvignon looks ok, but just doesn’t ripen, due to our short summer.

Lots more questions spinning around, I think having kids has changed the view of things. At peak times I get up at 5.30, two may be three days a week, and go work in the vineyard, podcasts keeping me company.  I can get a lot done, but I haven’t got the time to spray every 7 days, keep on top of the weeds, or improve canopy management.  Not enough time in the day, and now the days are getting shorter… would another 500 really be feasible?  When do I invest in a tractor and sprayer?  The back pack sprayer does a good job, but not for the unfit, another post to cover that one.  Is it profit I’m after, and how many vines do I need to do that?

On the cusp of something.  Knowledge is building.  Still a lot of known unknowns.

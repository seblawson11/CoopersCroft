title: We Bought a Field
---

## We found it!

After all our looking we found a 5 acre south-facing sloping site. The house was ok, needed work. It was definitely going to be our home.

The field was a corner of an arable field sold off 5 years before. A lot of ‘stuff’ that needed to be cleared, but the potential was there.

Clearing and preparation started pretty quickly. Perhaps too quickly…

We moved in March 2011. Lots to do, but the plan was to start planting the vines in Spring 2012.

The area had been under intensive arable production, up to when it was sold.  Since then it was scrub and grassland.  The soil type, the all important question, is clay with underlying chalk.  Agreed not ideal, as the clay will take an age to warm up in the Spring, although it does hold nutrients and water, plus the chalk is helpful with pH and hopefully add some characters to the wine.

The area for the first block was simply power harrowed, only to 3-4 inches, just to clear the weeds on the surface.  If I was doing this again (and I have) I would have more deeply cultivated to break up the clay pan.  Clay can make it difficult for the roots to get down into the soil.  Plus I would have spread spent mushroom compost to try to add some loam to the soil.

Of course you can try to get everything perfect, but the site has inherent qualities that perhaps are best not changed until you plant, see them grow, and then taste the first produce.  The site may not be ideal; 100m above sea level, the soil not perfect; clay with chalk, but I had passion and would learn as much as I could.
